## Synopsis

*libdiff* is a C library generating the shortest edit script, longest common
subsequence, and edit distance between arbitrary sequences of bytes.  It
derives from Tatsuhiko Kubo's [onp](https://github.com/cubicdaiya/onp) and
[dtl](https://github.com/cubicdaiya/dtl).

To compile on any modern UNIX system, run `./configure`, then `make` and
`make install`.

The library (one function) is documented in its manpage.
